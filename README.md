# todo-app-js-only
A todo app created using javascript only and without any library or framework.

One thing that I tried with this app is `proxy` for object to watch for the changes in property of an object. Working quite well for this simple use case that I had.

Do try out, use it, fork it. Code is provided as is and can be used freely by anyone.
